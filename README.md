# AI-CCTV-Activity-Detector# üé• AI CCTV Activity Detector

An **AI-based CCTV Activity Detection System** built using **YOLOv3-tiny (OpenCV DNN)** and **Streamlit**.  
This project detects objects and activities from CCTV footage or uploaded images/videos and logs the detections with live statistics.

## üß† Project Overview

The **AI CCTV Activity Detector** uses computer vision and deep learning to identify objects in real-time surveillance footage.  
It can serve as a base for **smart security systems**, **anomaly detection**, or **crowd monitoring** solutions.

### üîç Features
- Object detection using **YOLOv3-tiny**
- Supports **images and short video clips**
- Real-time **bounding box visualization**
- Automatic **activity logging** (CSV)
- **Detection analytics dashboard** (object counts, detection by hour, recent logs)
- Simple web interface built with **Streamlit**
